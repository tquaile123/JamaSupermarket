Review the following technical problem.	There are few basic requirements and inputs and	outputs
but the	design is completely open-ended. The solution should be delivered via a git repo (preferred)
or zip	file.		
	
The	Problem:	
A supermarket sells 3 products listed below:	
	
Product	A = $20	
Product	B = $50	(or 5 for the price of 3)	
Product	C = $30	
     
Implement the code for a checkout register that calculates the price of a given sequence of items. The input 
is a product list as a	String,	e.g “ABBACBBAB”: for which the output should be the integer 240. Please consider
testability, documentation, and	other good coding practices in your solution. As an additional challenge, consider 
how new pricing rules might be provided programmatically.	

Implement the following:	

public class Supermarket { 
    public int checkout(String items); 
}
